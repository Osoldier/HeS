# HeS

##Project description

HeS is a game i'm developing in my spare time, the goal of the game is to be build an intergalactic system. Depending on your good will it could be an authoritarian empire or a peaceful republic (or a bit of both); but what's certain is that you're going to have to destroy your enemies and conquer their territories.

The game is actually in an early stage of development and cannot even be considered a game atm, i'm developing it alone (with the help of some library/open codes)
